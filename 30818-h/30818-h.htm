<h2>SET DOWN FOR TRIAL.</h2>

<p class="salute"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch,</span></p>

<p>During the Winter Vacation, now at an end, I have been visiting some of
the theatres with a view to educating my eldest son. Hearing that in <i>A
Man's Shadow</i> at the Haymarket there was a representation of "the Assize
Chamber, Palais de Justice, Paris," I took <span class="smcap">Northbutt</span> (the name I have
given to my boy, in recognition of the kindness that is habitually shown
to the Junior Bar by two of the most courteous Judges of modern times)
to that temple of the Drama, and was delighted at the dignity and legal
acuteness displayed by Mr. <span class="smcap">Kemble</span> as the President of the Court. On
referring to the programme, I found that the part of the Usher was
played by Mr. <span class="smcap">Robb Harwood</span>, and I trust that learned Gentleman (I cannot
help feeling that from his Christian name, Mr. <span class="smcap">Harwood</span> must be connected
with the law) will forgive me if I make a few suggestions. It has been
my good fortune to be present in a French Court, and I can assure Mr.
<span class="smcap">Robb</span>, that the Usher is an infinitely more important personage than he
represents him to be. I am not a dramatist, but I can readily understand
that it might interfere with the interest of the play, and perhaps,
unduly damage the importance properly attributable to the utterances of
the Lessee of the theatre, were Mr. <span class="smcap">Robb</span> to give increased prominence to
his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> while Mr. <span class="smcap">Beerbohm Tree</span> is present in the character of
<i>Lucien Laroque</i>. But this is unnecessary, as Mr. <span class="smcap">Kemble</span> about the
middle of the sitting very properly adjourns the Court presumably for
luncheon. It is then, that the Usher should emerge from his comparative
obscurity, and, so to speak, make his mark. I jot down a rough idea of
my notion in dramatic form for the consideration of the adapter of the
piece, Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert Buchanan</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Assize Chamber (Palais of Justice, Paris).</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Kemble</span>
<i>has just retired with his colleagues to luncheon</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Beerbohm
Tree</span>, <i>as Laroque, has been removed in the custody of an old
officer, in a uniform produced by</i> Messrs. <span class="smcap">Nathan</span>, <i>from a sketch
by</i> "<span class="smcap">Karl</span>." (<i>Vide Programme.</i>) Mr. <span class="smcap">Fernandez</span> <i>is seen seated
beneath the dock</i>. Advocates <i>fraternise with a</i> Young Abb&eacute;, <i>who
has evidently a taste for sensational murder cases</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Usher</i> (<i>to Crowd</i>). Now then, Gentlemen, although the Court has
retired, you must keep order. (<i>A murmur.</i>) What, my authority defied!
Gendarmes, do your duty! (<i>The Gendarmes suppress Crowd.</i>) M. l'Abb&eacute;, a
word with you. (<i>The</i> Abb&eacute; <i>approaches</i> Usher <i>respectfully</i>.) I am told
by the Nurse of Mademoiselle <span class="smcap">Suzanne</span> that Madame <span class="smcap">Laroque</span> is dying. Can
you kindly let me see the Doctor who has the case in hand?</p>

<p><i>M. L'Abb&eacute;</i> (<i>glad of something to say</i>). Certainly, Monsieur. The
Doctor is one of my intimate friends, and will be proud of an
introduction.</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>Retires, in search of the Medical Man.</i></p>

<p><i>Usher.</i> Thank you! (<i>is given a letter by</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Beerbohm Tree</span>, <i>who has

<p><i>Mr. Tree's Shadow (clearing his throat).</i> Urrerrer! Take that to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Fernandez</span> over yonder, and wake him up with it! Urrerrerrer!</p>

snuff-box&mdash;it is heartily at your service. (Mr. <span class="smcap">Fernandez</span> <i>accepts the
courtesy with effusion</i>.) And now, my old friend, take this packet,
which I fancy is from your wife. I hope Madame is well? (Mr. <span class="smcap">Fernandez</span>
<i>smilingly bows and eats a sandwich</i>.) I am delighted to hear it.
(<i>Sternly to</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Tree</span>, <i>who has entered in another disguise</i>.) Well,
Monsieur, and what do <i>you</i> want with me?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Tree in another disguise (seizing the opportunity of showing his
well-known versatility).</i> I am the Doctor who is attending Madame

<h2>FOR THE SAKE OF THE EMPIRE.</h2>

<h4>The Empire of Melpomene and Terpsichore.</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the <span class="smcap">Shah</span> spent a pleasant evening in the Theatre of Varieties
North of Leicester Square (and if it comes to that, long before) the
Empire has been a notable place of entertainment. At the present moment
there is an exceptionally strong programme. Two <i>ballets</i>, both
extremely good. The first, "<i>The Paris Exhibition</i>," pleasingly recalls
the glories and expenses of last year so inseparably connected with the
Cairo street dancing and the Tour Eiffel. The second, "<i>A Dream of
Wealth</i>," is interesting amongst other matters for proving conclusively
that the Demon of Avarice (conscientiously impersonated by Signor <span class="smcap">Luigi
Albertieri</span>), is a singularly gentlemanly creature, and not nearly so
black as he would conventionally be painted. The story of the
<i>divertissement</i> by Madame <span class="smcap">Katti Lanner</span>, if rather obscure, is still
thoroughly enjoyable. It would seem that a miser with a comic but
sound-hearted clerk, after an altercation with some well-fed
representatives of "the most distrissful" tenantry that ever yet were
seen, makes the acquaintance of "an apparition," and dreams that he is
the tenant of his own jewel-casket. In his sleep he is present at a
<i>ballet</i> replete with silver and gold and precious stones, to say
nothing of shapely limbs and pretty faces, and makes great friends with
the "apparition," who shows him much graceful courtesy, with the
assistance of one of her acquaintances, that singularly gentlemanly
creature, the Demon of Avarice. That all ends happily goes without
saying.</p>

<p>But perhaps <i>the</i> feature of the Empire Theatre of Varieties (a title
justified by the programme&mdash;a document, by the way, for which a uniform
charge of two pence should be made, instead of "anything you please,
Sir," subsequently translatable into at least sixpence) is the
realisation, by Miss <span class="smcap">Amy Roselle</span>, of <i>The Woman and the Law</i>, written by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Clement Scott</span>. The accomplished actress, in a simple black dress, in
front of a scene suggestive of (say) an unused ball-room in the Vatican,
holds her audience in her grasp. In spite of the smoke of the stalls,
the levity of the lounge, and the general incongruity of her
surroundings, Miss <span class="smcap">Roselle</span> scores nightly a distinct success. Lastly,
Mlle. <span class="smcap">Vanoni</span>, returning to the scene of her former triumphs, once again
delights all beholders by the sprightliness of her singing and dancing.
No reason to fear the disruption of the Empire at present.</p>

<span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></center>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> come back from India. I was in Southampton. Only a few months
before I had been teaching whist to the natives on the banks of the
Ganges, and I had made my fortune out of the Indian rubber. I wonder if
they remember the great Sahib who always had seven trumps and only one
other suit. Tailoring is in its infancy over there, and the natives
frequently had no suit at all. I had not placed my money in the Ganges
banks, because they are notoriously unsafe. I had brought it with me to
Southampton. I was rich, but solitary. Yet I was a dashing young fellow,
especially in my printed conversation. When it rained, I said "dee."
Just smack your lips over the delightful wickedness of it, and then
proceed.</p>

<h4>She looked charming.</h4>
</div>

<p>There was nothing to do. I couldn't go to Ryde, although the waiter
assured me it was a pleasant trip. Neither did I care to go for a walk.
The situation was at a dead-lock, and I said so.</p>

<p>"Well," said the waiter, "there's the quay."</p>

<p>So I went to the quay. I heard a sweet young voice remark, "What a
shocking bad hat!" I fell in love with her at once. She was with a
governess&mdash;obviously French&mdash;who remonstrated.</p>

<p>"'Ush! Naughty! Signor will overhear you, Mees <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. Then I give you
spanks."</p>

<p>"Well, he shouldn't wear such a bad hat, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>I was just turning round to introduce myself, when I saw that they had
both stepped on to the steamer. I followed them. The French Governess
seemed to be in doubt about the boat.</p>

<p>"Antelope of the western horizon," she said, to a surly onlooker, "I
will give you three piastres and a French halfpenny if you have ze
goodness to tell me if this is ze Ryde steamer."</p>

<p>"How the dickens am I to know whether it's the right steamer or not,
when I don't know where you're going to?" asked the man.</p>

<p>I knocked him down at once, and as he rose to return the compliment my
hat fell off. Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span> caught it on the tip of her toe as it was
falling, sent it twenty feet into the air, caught it again in her large
beautiful hands, and pressed it firmly down over my eyes.</p>

<p>In the wilds of Assam one gets unused to the grand freedom and cultured
geniality of English ladies. I hardly knew what to do, but I extricated
myself slowly from the folds of the hat, chucked her under the chin, and
remarked, "<i>Houp-l&agrave;!</i>" The French Governess had retired to the cabin to
be ill, and we were rapidly steaming from the quay.</p>

<p>"Don't!" said Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, looking very shy and pretty.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I replied. "Of course you will have some tea with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my!" she murmured, in her sweet, refined voice. "Well, I must first
go and look after poor Mlle. <span class="smcap">Donnerwetter</span>."</p>

<p>While she was below, I secured two umbrellas from the stoker, and
improvised a sort of tent with this and a back number of the <i>Times</i>. I
also procured a few delicacies such as young girls love&mdash;a pot of French
mustard, two bottles of ginger-beer, some shrimps, and several large
buns. I spread them all out in a row. It seemed to make them look more
luscious, somehow. We were very warm and cosy, seated over the boiler of
the engine. Was I in love? Pshaw! Decidedly not, and yet&mdash;well, she
looked very pretty as she sat there, chattering freely about herself,
and lightly dusting with her handkerchief one of the shrimps which was a
trifle soiled. I gathered from her conversation that she was very rich,
that she had no parents, and would lose all her money if something
happened.</p>

<p>"And is that something&mdash;er&mdash;marriage?" I ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"Gar'n!" she replied, in her pretty school-girl slang. "What are yer
getting at?"</p>

<p>"Suppose the boiler blew up, what then?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she replied, sadly; "Mademoiselle will blow me up if she finds us
out. Listen! she's calling."</p>

<p>"Then it's all right, because if she calls now she'll find us in."</p>

<p>At this moment the steamer reached its destination, and I was compelled
to leave Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. However, I followed her and the Governess until
they entered the gates of Plumfields, a large school for young ladies.
Why should I go back to Southampton? I think I will remain at Ryde.</p>

<h2>THE SOUNDS OF THE STREETS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> Special Nuisance Commissioner continued yesterday afternoon
this adjourned inquiry, which, having now arrived at the stage of
dealing with "street-music," at present attracting so much public
notice, invested the proceedings with an unusual amount of interest.</p>

<p>The Commissioner, on taking his seat, said that, since they last met, he
had been rather puzzling himself with the distinction that might be
drawn between a "particular" and a "general" or a "pretty general"
nuisance, and he had come to the conclusion that he much doubted whether
this latter kind had any definite existence, as there were always to be
found disagreeable people, themselves the most intolerable nuisances,
ready to support and encourage anything that might prove a source of
annoyance or even distraction to their more rational neighbours. It was
by these growling and cantankerous philanthropists that German "Bands of
Three," or even damaged bagpipes, were invited by halfpence to make
hideous noises in quiet back-streets. He merely offered these remarks
for what they were worth, in passing, and he would now proceed to listen
to such fresh evidence as might be forthcoming.</p>

<p>A Nervous Invalid (who was led in tottering, and immediately supplied
with a chair, into which he sank in an exhausted condition) said, in a
feeble voice, that his present shattered state he attributed solely to
the never-ceasing strain to which his nerves had been subjected by the
continuous Babel of street-noises that invaded the suburban quarter in
which he had been induced to take up his residence in the belief that he
was ensuring himself a quiet and snug retreat. (<i>Sensation.</i>) From the
moment when he was roused from his slumbers in the early morning by
Sweeps who came to attend to somebody else's chimneys&mdash;(<i>cries of
"Shame!"</i>)&mdash;to a late hour, frequently close on eleven at night, when a
loud-lunged urchin bawled out a false alarm of a local murder in the
"latest edition," his whole life was one continual contest with organs,
with or without monkeys or babies, shouting fern-vendors, brass bands,
broken-winded concertinas, Italian brigands, choruses of family beggars,
tearing milk-carts, itinerant twilight ballad-singers, and other
disturbers of the public peace. (<i>Groans.</i>) And the result, from the
series of shocks his system had now been continually sustaining for
several years, was the condition to which the Commissioner could see he
had been reduced, which he could only characterise as that of one who,
once blithe, gay, happy, and active, was now a complete physical and
mental wreck, to whom, if he could see no prospect of coming relief,
the gloom of life appeared to stretch away as a vast wilderness, with a
prospect of such overwhelming depression, that he could only conclude
his evidence with the significant but heartrending warning that he could
face it no longer! The Witness here fairly broke down, and, bursting
into a hysterical fit of weeping, had to be led from the room by a bevy
of sympathising friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Commissioner</span> (<i>much moved</i>). Dear me! this is very distressing! Can
the Police be of no use? (<i>A Voice. "Not the slightest!"</i>) Indeed! Ah!
that's very awkward. However, we had better proceed with the evidence.
Is there anyone to be heard on the other side?</p>

<p>A Big Drum of the Salvation Army hereupon said he had something to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Commissioner.</span> By all means. We are all attention.</p>

<p>The Big Drum said he had been frequently charged with creating a
disturbance. This charge he utterly repudiated. Of course, if such
trifles as destroying the tranquillity of an English Sunday, disturbing
the peaceful worship of other denominations, creating a street
obstruction or two, frightening an occasional omnibus horse into a fit
of kicking, and perhaps leading up to some local excitement culminating
in a possible riot, be regarded as "disturbing the public peace" then,
of course, the Salvationists must plead guilty. As to "making a noise,"
their mission was to "make a noise," and he flattered himself that the
"Big Drum" was not behind-hand, at all events, in that business. As far
as "making a noise" was concerned, all processions accompanied by bands
aimed at this. The Salvation Army was only in the same boat with the
rest. (<i>Oh! oh!</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Commissioner.</span> Just so. And for that reason a short Act should be
passed licensing only such processions as have a national, civic, or
State character as their <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>. That, I think, would
effectively dispose of the big drum nuisance. (<i>Cheers.</i>)</p>

<p>A Flute-player, who from his habit of playing, in the dim twilight,
Scotch airs without sharps or flats, but with sudden turns and trills,
had become the terror of several quiet suburban squares, was here about
to be heard in his own defence, when the proceedings were interrupted by
strains of a German Band that had taken up its station in the street
outside, and commenced an imperfect rehearsal of an original valse
composed by the Conductor.</p>

<p>On the Commissioner having given orders that it should be stopped
forthwith, and it being intimated to him that, in the absence of any
policeman, it declined to move off or cease playing under
eighteen-pence; he thereupon expressed himself strongly on the present
unsatisfactory condition of the existing law, and, explaining at the top
of his voice, that it would be no use continuing his remarks through a
noise in which he could not possibly make himself heard, hastily
adjourned the meeting. And thus the business of the day came suddenly to
an unexpected and abrupt conclusion.</p>

<h2>DIARY OF A JOLLY PARTY.</h2>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;We are a party of twelve at breakfast. A merry party. With
children we make fifteen. Some one reads out about Russian Influenza. We
laugh. In the daytime, we ride, lounge, shoot. Dinner. Somebody is
indisposed and doesn't appear. Also a child has caught cold. But Russian
Influenza!&mdash;absurd!</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;We are a party of ten this morning at breakfast. Only three
children appear. One, a boy who hears his holidays have been extended
over the fortnight, is very happy. No Russian Influenza here. Our
hostess does not think it necessary to send for the Doctor, who lives
three miles off, as the two children have only a slight cold, and the
two guests don't happen to be quite well, that's all. Headache slightly,
both. At dinner our host, who won't believe in Russian Influenza, says
that he's afraid he has rheumatism coming on. Hot grog, we all agree, is
the best remedy. Remedy accordingly, with pipes. Two of the ladies
retire early, "not feeling quite the thing," and at eleven our host says
he thinks he'll turn in. We bid him good-night, hope he'll be better,
and then sit down and discuss news. Odd that people and children should
be taken ill, but no one will for a moment admit the possibility of
Influenza touching <i>us</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i> Seven at breakfast. No host. No children down for
breakfast; but all apparently "down" with cold, or&mdash;something. Hostess
comes in, apologises for being late, but much bothered about children,
specially the boy who has got extra fortnight. He's got "something" now
besides extra fortnight. "Something," but not Influenza. Very feverish
in the night; so were the two ladies; so was the host. The hostess, who
is great in medicines, specially new ones, has cupboards full of bottles
of Eno and Pyrrhetic Saline (or some such name&mdash;I'm not sure that it
isn't "Pyrotechnic Saline") and her latest fad is Salt Regal. "Children
like it," she says," because it turns pink, and is pretty to look at."
If some of her simple remedies, including foreign waters with strange
names on them, don't succeed, she will send for Doctor. We begin to
think of returning to town. Also begin to wonder if all this can
possibly be the Epidemic.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Dinner, rather dull. The Butler is feeble. Crossing the
parquet he is down with a dish. In another hour he is down with&mdash;shall
we begin to say&mdash;Influenza? I thought Influenza was sneezing and
coughing and the most violent of colds. Yet I hear very little of that
in the house. I shall pack up and leave to-morrow morning. Sharp pain in
back as I stoop over portmanteau. Feel queer in head. Pains all down my
legs. Within an hour pains everywhere. Remember at school when one boy
obstructed another's view, the latter would ask him to "get out of the
light, as your father wasn't a glazier, and I can't see through you."
Think my father must have been a glazier as I am so full of "panes." How
bad my head must be to make this jest.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Don't know how many at breakfast. I'm not. Doctor summoned,
visits me. "I suppose," I say, by way of instructing him in the view
that I want him to take, "I suppose I've got a slight chill, and this
afternoon I shall be able to wrap up and get to town?" "Oh, dear, no,"
replies Doctor. "You'll take Ammoniated Quinine at once." "You don't
mean to say that it's&mdash;&mdash;" "Influenza?" he asks. I nod. Yes, that is
exactly what it is, they have all got it in the house, he tells me, and
no one will be able to leave for the next ten days! How pleasant for our
hosts! I did not believe in Influenza. I do now. Its French name is <i>La
Grippe</i>. <i>Je suis gripp&eacute;.</i> This means more than a weak name like
"Influenza."</p>

<h2>CALLS FOR THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR?</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> for the first time, and not for the last, <i>Mr. Punch</i> asks, where is
The Public Prosecutor? Why is it that the observations of Mr. Justice
<span class="smcap">Butt</span> and Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Hawkins</span> are disregarded? Very much "for the public
benefit" was the sentence of one year's imprisonment passed on the
journalist who, without one tittle of trustworthy evidence, attempted to
blast the character of an innocent man. But is it not still more for the
public benefit that professional perjurers, suborners of witnesses, and
fabricators of false evidence&mdash;the suborners first and foremost&mdash;should
be publicly proceeded against, and treated with the utmost rigour of the
law? <span class="smcap">Winser</span>, the cabman, who gave his false evidence so gaily in the
Thirkettle Case, has been had up, and sentenced. Having dealt with
<span class="smcap">Winser</span>, it is only a short step from <span class="smcap">Winser</span> to <span class="smcap">Slough</span>&mdash;but perhaps such
a slough of muck, that it wants the pluck of a Hercules in the Aug&aelig;an
stable to commence operations, and a <i>deus ex-machin&acirc;</i>&mdash;that is, the
Public Prosecutor from the Treasury&mdash;to see that the proceedings are not
abortive. Oh, where, and Oh, where is The Public Prosecutor?</p>

<p>RRIVING at the Great Northern Station at King's Cross, and desirous of
testing the culture of the clerk at the Booking-office, you ask for a
first-class return for Hetfelle. The clerk mechanically puts out his
hand towards the receptacle for tickets, drops it, stares at you, and
says Hetfelle is not on their line. You insist that it must be, being
clearly set forth in <i>Domesday Book</i>. The clerk shows a disposition to
speak alliteratively but disrespectfully of <i>Domesday</i>, and, as the
crowd presses at your heels, you yield to modern prejudice, and take
your ticket for Hatfield. Still, you have the satisfaction of knowing
that it was <i>Hetfelle</i> when the Abbey of Ely held it by favour of King
<span class="smcap">Edgar</span>.</p>

<p>When Ely was made a bishopric, the Bishops lived at <i>Hetfelle</i>, which
presently came to be known as Bishops Hatfield, and a sumptuous palace
was built, that housed in turn a son of <span class="smcap">Edward the Third</span>, and the son
and heir of <span class="smcap">Henry the Eighth</span>. The latter Prince coming to the throne,
under the title of <span class="smcap">Edward the Sixth</span>, he gave Hatfield to his sister, the
Princess <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. When, in due time, you arrive at Hatfield, your host
takes you out, leading you by the stately avenue to show you the oak
under which <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> was sitting, reading Greek, when news came to her
that <span class="smcap">Mary</span> was dead, and <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> reigned in her stead.</p>

<p>"<i>La reine est morte; Vive la reine!</i>" you opportunely remark.</p>

<p>"Quite so," says the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>, evidently struck by your readiness of
rejoinder.</p>

<p>You approach Hatfield House by the gateway near the Church, and enter an
oblong court bounded by the west wing of the Bishop's Palace, now a
stately wreck, with horses stabled in the Hall where one time Bishops
and Princes sat at meat. You feel inclined to linger here, and moralise
upon the theme. But you perceive your noble host awaiting you on the
broad steps of the magnificent Jacobean mansion, a picture worthy to be
set in such a framework. It is like a portrait of one of the earlier
<span class="smcap">Cecils</span> stepped out of the frame in the Long Gallery. The stately figure
is attired in white doublet, trunks, and hose, embroidered with pearls.
On the purple surcoat, lined with red, gold buttons gleam. The white
ruff is fastened at wrist and throat with gold buttons: the black cap is
solely adorned with a knot of pearls; a golden cord hangs from the neck;
the right hand rests upon the head of a large dog, that has, perhaps, a
rather stuffed look; whilst the left negligently lounges on the hip
above the ready sword.</p>

<p>Is it <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, Earl of Exeter? Or is it his half-brother, <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, Earl of
Salisbury, joint ancestor of the two great branches of the <span class="smcap">Cecil</span> family?
Or is it, perchance, <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, Earl of Salisbury, or <span class="smcap">James Cecil</span>, first
<span class="smcap">Markiss</span>?</p>

<p>A familiar voice breaks the charm, and discloses the secret.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Hatfield, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, dear boy; but don't suppose that every day I
am got up in this style. It is only in honour of your visit, and as soon
as you are gone, I doff my doublet and hose, put on an old coat, and go
down into my workshop, where I have a little tinkering to do with one of
the electric wires which has gone wrong, and threatens to burn up the
premises. So glad to see you. Always think these informal conferences
between individual members of the two Houses are not only personally
agreeable, but may be fraught with the greatest benefit to the State,
which we both serve. Wait till you see my dog move."</p>

<p>The noble <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>, stooping down a little stiffly (owing to the
tightness of the hose), turned a clock-key. After a few rotations, the
dog, being set in the right direction, moved out of the way.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>, pleased at my enthusiasm, "that is rather a
triumph, I think. It is common enough to see an automatic dog move its
two fore-paws; but, observe, <i>all</i> the paws here work in natural
sequence. Took me six months to bring this to perfection, working at it
at the time when you would read in the newspapers of my conspiring with
<span class="smcap">Hartington</span> to keep out <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, or negociating with <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span> to pull
the chestnuts out of the fire for him in Africa."</p>

<p>Your host leads you to King James's Room, a fine apartment, which stands
to-day in exactly the state in which the King left it when he got up to
breakfast. But the place is a little stuffy, and you do not care for the
particular state of fadedness yet reached by the Turkey carpet. Walking
beside your host, with one eye on the sword, which seems determined to
get between somebody's legs, you pace the Marble Hall, cricking your
neck with gazing upon the heads of the C&aelig;sars that look down on you from
panels in the coved ceiling. Up you go by the grand staircase with its
massive carved baluster with unclothed Highlanders playing the bagpipes
and lions bearing heraldic shields; into the Long Gallery, with its
coats of mail, its antique japanned cabinets, its cradle in which
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> squealed, its massive fireplaces, its rare panelling; into the
Armoury, where you try on several suits of armour and handle relics of
the Great Armada cast ashore in the spacious times of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>; on to
the Library with its rare collection of papers, including Lord
<span class="smcap">Burleigh's</span> <i>Diary</i>, in which you are privileged to read in the original
manuscript the well-known poem which tells how:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i2">Is so great a lord as he."</p>
</div></div>

<p>On to the Summer Dining-room through the Winter Dining-room, into the
Drawing-room, and thence into the Chapel where you admire the painted
window of Flemish work, representing in compartments various scriptural
subjects.</p>

<p>You have been so interested in the journey, that there has been no time
for <span class="smcap">Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoigne-Cecil</span>, P.C., K.G., Third Marquis of
Salisbury, Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, and Prime Minister of England, to tell you the story of
his life. This you the less regret, as the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> is manifestly growing
increasingly uncomfortable in his doublet and hose. So he conducts you
to the hall, and bids you a friendly farewell. As you walk down the
Avenue&mdash;"The Way to London," as <span class="smcap">Cecils</span> dead and buried used to call
it&mdash;you turn to take one last look at the noble pile, Italian
renaissance in character, of two orders, the lower Doric, the upper
Ionic, with a highly-enriched Elizabethan central gate-tower, and
stepped gables.</p>
